# My_Portifolio_App
This is my implementation of the My-App-Portifolio
app. I have done it in order to consolidate my knowledge as Udacity Code Reviewer.
It is just a basic app which has buttons, each time a button is clicked the user will see a toast with a simple message about 
the button touched.
